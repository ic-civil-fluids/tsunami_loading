# SWASH Simulations of Tsunami Waves

This folder contains all input files necessary to reproduce the SWASH Simulations of the nine Error Function (ERF) wave cases.

Public use for the readership of Ocean Engineering.

## Usage

The bot folder contains the bed geometry for each of the wave categories, in .bot format.

The spec folder contains the wave gauge measurements for each of the nine ERF waves, in .spec format. 

The sws folder contains the SWASH input files necessary for running the SWASH simulations in .sws format. These reference the relevant .bot and .spec files.

## Dependencies

The code has been generated for SWASH Version 11.01. Further information on implementation can be in the User Manual.
