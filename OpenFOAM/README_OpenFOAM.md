# OpenFOAM Simulations of Tsunami Waves

This folder contains all input files necessary to reproduce the OpenFOAM Simulation of Error Function (ERF) wave case B2.

Public use for the readership of Ocean Engineering.

## Usage

All necessary geometry files are included in the system folder.

All necessary wave inputs are included in the constant folder.

The initial conditions are provided in the -999.org folder.

The simulation should be run by executing the Allrun file.

## Dependencies

The code has been tested on OpenFOAM-v1812 with waves2Foam. Further information on implementation can be in the waves2Foam Manual.
