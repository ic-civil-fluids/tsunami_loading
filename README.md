# Wave loading predictions
Codes to accompany the paper *"Tsunami-induced loads on coastal structures: experimental investigation and prediction"* by Millar et al. 2025.

The repository contains two folders with the necessary setup files to reproduce numerical results on tsunami-induced wave loaidng on coastal infrastructure. These include
- SWASH simulations
- OpenFOAM simulations
